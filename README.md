# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the working day. 

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

Used the [Moment.js] API to get the current date/time.

Used jQuery powered CSS powered to create color codes for the actual, past and future hours. 

Used localstorage on the browser to save all user inputs.
